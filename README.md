# WinGameOfLife
This is a first attempt to create an interactive version of Conway's Game of Life.
After starting the application, a grid is displayed.
The user enters a pattern into the grid by clicking cells with the mouse.  For example, a simple pattern would be a horizontal line
consisting of 5 consecutive filled in cells.
The user then click on the Operation menu item and selects Start.
The pattern changes at one-second intervals based on the rules of the Game of Life.

Currently, the Operation menu items Pause, Resume, and Stop are inoperable.
